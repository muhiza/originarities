            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                ASI-D is a non-profit group of bloggers from around the world.
                We practice a style of reporting that's off the beaten path and designed for human beings.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our articles cover a wide-range of different topics.
                Unity, Mir, Compiz, KDE, Gnome, Firefox, Chrom(ium), and Blender
                are just some of the many open-source tools and apps we have written about.
                We provide tutorials, tips, reviews, news, and the occasional rant.
                (We try to keep the rants to a minimum.)
            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
                We're not quite as old as Ubuntu, but our archives span a number of years.
                Here's a brief overview of how we got our start and what happened after that.

                        ASI-D was founded around March 2011 by Roland Taylor, and later
                        expanded to included the likes of Joshua P. Bell, James Gifford, Nathan Osman, Amith K.K. and Nitin Venkatesh.
                        These six are our current site and community administrators.

                        Our blogging platform was originally a Wordpress-powered blog.
                        We have changed web hosts a number of times - we have used everything
                        from <a href="http://ondina.co">Ondina</a> to
                        <a href="http://rackspace.com">Rackspace</a>.
                        Our current blogging engine is a set of custom Django apps hosted
                        on a VPS "in the cloud."
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The site domain name is owned by Joshua Bell, and the our blogging platform was
                        created by Nathan Osman. Our social networking artwork (as featured on Google+,
                        Twitter and Facebook) was created by Roland Taylor and released as Open Source
                        without a specific license. James Gifford runs our "hotline" and champions our
                        mailing list and server logs.

                    <p>
                        Our tagline, "News For Human Beings," was inspired by "Linux for human beings,"
                        the tagline of the Ubuntu project.
